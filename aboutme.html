<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am a student studying in Irvine, California. I go to Irvine High School, and am a Freshmen. </p>

<h2>My history</h2>
<p>I was born on October 22nd, 2004. I lived in Yongin, a city in Korea, on my young days. I went to an Engish kindergarden, and learned English for the first time. After graduating,
I moved to Madrid, Spain because of my father's work. I went to St. Georges School, Madrid for three years. Then I moved to Hofheim, Germany. I went to ISF for one year. After the 
four years of staying in Europe, I went to Korea again. I went to Yongin again, and went to Yongin Daedeok elementary school. After 2 years, I graduated and went to Yongin Daedeok
middle school. After 2 years and a half, I moved to Irvine, California. I am now attending Irvine High School, and my history is continuing now.</p>

<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p>I like to play games, and soccer. I play League of Legends, Minecraft, FIFA, and lots of other steam games. I like to play soccer with my friends, and I play as defender. 
My strength is long passing and stopping others. I also like to watch youtube. Actually I love watching it that I spend too much time on it. I like to watch gaming, history, soccer
channels. </p>

<h2>My interests</h2>
<p>I am interested in subjects related to humanities and computers. They don't match, but I want to have a job related to computers and be erudite in history. I want to know the
roots of languages, all the parts of history, and maybe write a book of them. In computer related stuff, I want to learn languages for example C and Python. It would be awesome to 
make a game of mine by using those stuff. Lastly, I have a huge passion on learning foreign languages. I think the experience on Europe when I was young intrigued me. Currently I am
fluent in Korean and English; I am learning Spanish in school and Japanese by Duolingo. I want to speak more European language, to communicate with others on real life or internet.</p>
